My name is Romeo and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on February 14, 2020 because a new family member is allergic. I lived in a home with another cat and a lab. I have lived with a kid, but prefer calm people that will let me do my own thing. My previous owner described me as tempermental at first, but cuddlebug once I trust you.<p/><p/>I like getting attention on my own terms. I can get overstimulated with petting, so please move carefully with me and keep an eye out for signs that I might need a break.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p/>",RED

My name is Golden and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on February 12, 2020 because they couldn't give me the time I needed. I lived in a home with younger children. My previous owner described me as sweet and shy.<p/><p/>I am an independent dog who likes to do my own thing! I am shy at first but warm up with my favorite treat- wet dog food!<p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I seem to do well with othe large dogs. In fact, I would probably do best in a home with another dog woh loves to run and play, and can help me build my confidence! When meeting dogs in a new home, I would do best with a slow introduction.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",RED

When I was a wee little one, I was not taught how nice and friendly people can be, but I am learning quickly! Though I may be timid at first, once you take the time to show me I can trust you I will show you just how wonderful I can be. I would love to go home with a confident kitty friend who can help me come out of my shell! While at the shelter I have gotten more confident and I enjoy being petted and played with!  I love string toys and getting neck rubs!  <p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p/>",BLUE
