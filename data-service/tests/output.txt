My name is Dusty and I am available for adoption. I was brought in by my previous owner on 2/12/20 because they could no longer keep me. I lived in a home with a large dog and my owner reported that I liked to follow her around and groom her. My owner described me as shy and said that I am a very good hunter. <p/><p/>I can be an independent kitty who likes to do my own thing. My friends at the shelter reported that once I warm up I am a very sweet and affectionate girl! I may get overstimulated with petting, so please move carefully with me and keep an eye out for signs that I might need a break.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p/>;02/12/2020 12:00:00 AM;https://petharbor.com/get_image.asp?RES=Detail&LOCATION=KING&ID=A607545;KIRKLAND,WA,98033

I was brought in by a good samaritan on 12/23/19.<p/><p/>I have spent some time in foster care and my foster family says I am a shy but sweet girl! I do not jump on the furniture but I like to follow my people around the house. I am pretty calm and I don't mind being held. I ignore the guinea pig in the house and I seem to do well with small children. <p/><p/>I am living with my rabbit friend, Coco, in foster care. We get along great and we would love to go home together! <p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving bunny who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/><p/>;12/23/2019 12:00:00 AM;https://petharbor.com/get_image.asp?RES=Detail&LOCATION=KING&ID=A603821;KENT,WA,98032
